# AWS Lambda and API Gateway CRUD Example

This repository contains a sample project that demonstrates how to implement a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API using AWS Lambda and API Gateway. The API allows you to manage product data for an online store, including adding new products, retrieving product details, updating product information, and deleting products.

## API Endpoints

GET /product: Retrieve a list of all available products in the store.

GET /product/{id}: Retrieve detailed information about a specific product by its unique ID.

POST /product: Add a new product to the store's inventory.

PUT /product/{id}: Update an existing product's information by its unique ID.

DELETE /product/{id}: Delete a product from the store's inventory by its unique ID.
